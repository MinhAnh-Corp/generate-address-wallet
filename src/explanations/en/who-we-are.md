# How I Built This Web App

I used **Cursor** (an AI-powered code editor) to build this wallet tools web application, along with some experience in web development, including building the explorer for [STOChain](https://stochainscan.io/en).

## Tech Stack

- **React** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Ant Design** for UI components
- **Jotai** for state management
- **i18next** for internationalization
- **Ethers.js** and **CosmJS** for blockchain wallet operations

## Features

- Generate BIP39 mnemonic phrases
- Generate both EVM and Cosmos wallets from a single mnemonic or private key
- Convert Cosmos addresses between different prefixes
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Multi-language support (English/Vietnamese)
- Fully client-side - no data sent to servers
